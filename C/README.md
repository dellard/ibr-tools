# C utilities

## Building the C utilities

To build the C utilities and install their executables in `../bin`, run
the following command:

`make install`

## Other commands

`make` without any arguments builds the executables, but does not
install them.

`make clean` removes objects and executables from this directory (but
does not remove anything from `../bin`).
